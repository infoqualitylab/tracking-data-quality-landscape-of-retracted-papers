# tracking-data-quality-landscape-of-retracted-papers
This project investigates the quality of retraction metadata in publication titles and tracks changes in retraction indexing over time, highlighting discrepancies that may impact research integrity. The project focuses on two analyses:

#### Analysis 1
Investigated how consistently retraction flags (e.g., “retracted article,”,“retracted”, “removal notice”) used in the titles of retracted publications indexed in Crossref reflect their true retraction status.

#### Analysis 2 
Investigated 208 DOIs that were indexed as retracted in Crossref’s April 2023 list but were no longer indexed as retracted in July 2024, despite remaining in the Crossref database.
